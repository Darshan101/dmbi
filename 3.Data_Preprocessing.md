**. What is Data Preprocessing ? Explain different methods for Data cleansing phase.**
1. Data have quality if they satisfy the requirements of the intended use. There are many factors comprising data quality,        including accuracy, completeness, consistency, etc.
2. Sometimes, the data you wish to analyze by using data mining techniques are incomplete, inaccurate, noisy or inconsistent.
3. There are many possible reasons for faulty data, such as faulty ata collection instruments, human or computer errors, intentional submission of incorrect data by users, data transmission errors, variations in naming conventions and so on.
4. Such data needs to be preprocessed for finding out anomalies and inaccuracies. If data preprocessing is not performed, the         information obtained after data mining may be unreliable.
5. Data cleaning or data cleansing is the first step in data preprocessing and attempts to fill in missing values, smooth out noise while identifying outliers and correct inconsistencies in the data. Following are the different methods for data cleansing phase:
  a.Filling Missing Values:
    i)Ignore the tuple
    ii)Fill in the missing value manually
    iii)Use a global constant to fill in the missing value.
    iv)Use a central tendnecy measure for the attribute to fill in the missing value.
    v)Use the attribute mean or median for all samples belonging to the same class as the given tuple.
    vi)Use the most probable value to fill in the missing value.
  b.Smoothing Noisy Data:
    i)Binning: Binning methods smooth out a sorted data value by consulting its neighborhood, that is the values around it. The   sorted values are distributed into buckets or bins. Smoothing can be applied on the created bins using the bin means, bin medians or the bin boundaries.
    ii)Regression: Data smoothing can also be done using regression, a technique that conforms data values to a function.
    iii)Outlier Analysis: Outliers may be detected by clustering. Similar values are organized into groups or clusters. Intuitively, values that fall outside of the set of clusters may be considered outliers.
  c)Data Cleaning as a Process: It invovles various methods by which data inconsistency can be eliminated and data can be normalized:
    i)Discrepancy Detection
    ii)Data Scrubbing
    iii)Data Auditing
