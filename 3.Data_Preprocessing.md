**. What is Data Preprocessing ? Explain different methods for Data cleansing phase.**

**. Why data preprocessing is required ? Explain different steps involved in the data preprocessing.*

**. Partition the given the data into 4 bins using eqi-dept binning method and perform smoothing according to the folowing methods.
Smoothing by bin means
Smoothing by bin median
Smoothing by bin boundries*
**Data : 11, 13, 13,  15, 15, 16, 19, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30, 40, 45, 45, 45, 71, 72, 73, 75**
Partitioning the data set into 4 bins
  Bin 1: 11, 13, 13, 15, 15, 16
  Bin 2: 19, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21
  Bin 3: 22, 23, 24, 30, 40, 45
  Bin 4: 45, 45, 71, 72, 73, 75
Smoothing by bin means:
  Bin 1: 12.17, 12.17, 12.17, 12.17, 12.17, 12.17
  Bin 2: 24.20, 24.20, 24.20, 24.20, 24.20, 24.20
  Bin 3: 30.67, 30.67, 30.67, 30.67, 30.67, 30.67
  Bin 4: 63.50, 63.50, 63.50, 63.50, 63.50, 63.50
Smoothing by bin median:
  Bin 1: 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14
  Bin 2: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20
  Bin 3: 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27
  Bin 4: 36.50, 36.50, 36.50, 36.50, 36.50, 36.50 
Smoothing by bin boundaries:
  Bin 1: 11, 11, 11, 16, 16, 16
  Bin 2: 19, 19, 19, 19, 21, 21
  Bin 3: 22, 22, 22, 22, 45, 45
  Bin 4: 45, 45, 75, 75, 75, 75
