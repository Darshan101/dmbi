1. A table below shows a sample dataset of whether a customer responds to the survey or not. “Outcome” is a class label. Construct a Decision tree classifier for the dataset. For a new example ( Rural, semidetached, low, No)  what will be the predicted class.

2. Brifly explain Bagging and Boosting of the Classfiers

Bagging (stands for Bootstrap Aggregation) is the way decrease the variance of your prediction by generating additional data for training from your original dataset using combinations with repetitions to produce multisets of the same cardinality/size as your original data. By increasing the size of your training set you can't improve the model predictive force, but just decrease the variance, narrowly tuning the prediction to expected outcome.

Boosting is a two-step approach, where one first uses subsets of the original data to produce a series of averagely performing models and then "boosts" their performance by combining them together using a particular cost function (=majority vote). Unlike bagging, in the classical boosting the subset creation is not random and depends upon the performance of the previous models: every new subsets contains the elements that were (likely to be) misclassified by previous models.


3. Define Classification, Issues of Classification and Explain ID3 classfication with example.


4. Explain different methods that can be used to evaluate and compare accuracy of different classfication algorthms.


5. Use any classification techniques and find out the class of (Homeowner = Yes, Status = Employed , Income = Average)

ID,Homeowner,Status,Income, Defaulted
1,Yes,Employed,High,No,
2,No,Business,Average,NO
3,No,Employed,Low,No
4,Yes,Business,High,No
5,No,Unemployed,Average,Yes
6,No,Business,Low,No
7,Yes,Unemployed,High,No
8,No,Employed,Average,Yes
9,No,Business,Low,No
10,No,Employed,Average,Yes
