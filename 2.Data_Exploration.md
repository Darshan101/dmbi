1. For the given data set
    1. Find the mean,mode and median.
    2. Show the boxplot of the data clearly indicating five numbers sumary of data.

Data : 11, 13, 13,  15, 15, 16, 19, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30, 40, 45, 45, 45, 71, 72, 73, 75


2. Explain different data visualization techniques that can be used in Data Mining
The different visualization techniques include

Geometric techniques: scatterplots matrices, Hyperslice,parallel coordinates
Pixel-oriented techniques: simple line-by-line, spiral and circle segments
Hierarchical techniques: Treemap, cone trees
Graph-based techniques: 2D and 3D graph
User interaction: brushing, linking, dynamic projections and rotations, dynamic queries

1.Geometric techniques

Basic idea:
• Visualization of geometric transformations andprojections of the data

Methods:
• Scatterplot matrices: A scatterplot matrix is composed of scatter plots of all possible pairs of
variables in a dataset.Assuming a N-dimension dataset, there are (N2-N)/2 pairs of two dimension plots
• Hyperslice :HyperSlice is an extension of the scatterplot matrix. They represent a
multi-dimensional function as a matrix of orthogonal two-dimensional slices
• Parallel coordinates: • The axes are defined as parallel vertical lines separated A point in Cartesian coordinates
correspond to a polyline in parallel coordinates Able to visualize data that may be occluded in Cartesian coordinates

2.Pixel-oriented techniques

Basic idea:
• The basic idea of pixel-oriented techniques is to map eachdata value to a colored pixel
• Each attribute value is represented by a pixel with a colortone proportional to a relevance factor in a separate
window
Methods:
• Simple Arrangement Line-by-Line
• Spiral and Circle Segments Techniques

3.Hierarchical techniques

Basic idea:
• Visualization of the data using a hierarchical partitioning into two- or three-dimensional
subspaces
Methods:
• Treemap:Divide a limited screen space display area into a sequence of rectangles whose areas correspond to an attribute of data set
• Cone trees:3-dimensional extension of the more familiar 2-D hierarchical tree structures, to a more intuitive navigation and display of information

4.Graph Tree: Graphs (edges + nodes) with labels and attributes
• Used where emphasis is on data relationship
(databases, telecom)
• Coordinates not always meaningful
• Useful for discovering patterns

Methods:
• 3D graphs: It has more room for objects and different points of view
 Example (hypertexts – Narcissus) 

5.User interaction
Methods:
• Brushing: selecting points or regions
• Linking: more views work together
• Dynamic projections and rotations :Interactively and continuously moving through subspaces
• Dynamic queries
– Visual interface (button and sliders)
– Incremental behavior (undo)

3. What is text mining ? Explain different approaches to the text mining ?


4. Describe different types of attributes which may come in Data Mining. Give two example of each type.

 
5. Explain different types of distance measures that can be used to compute the distances between two clusters ?

6. Consider the following data points 

12,15,16,16,19,20,21,22,22,25,25,25,25,30,33,33,35,35,35,35,36,40,45,46,52,70
a) What is the mean of the data ? what is the median ?
b) What is the mode of the data ?
c) What is the midrange of the data ?
d) Can you find (roughly ) first quartile and third quartile of the data ? 
e) Show a box plot of the data.

7. Describe the different visualization techniques that can be used in the data mining.
