1. What is hierarchical cleastering ? Explain any two techniques for finding distance between the clusters in hierarchical clustering ?


2. Use any hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster the following 8 examples into three clusters 

A1 = (2,10)
A2 = (2,5)
A3 = (8,4)
A4 = (5,8)
A5 = (7,5)
A6 = (6,4)
A7 = (1,2)
A8 = (4,9)


3. Clearly explain the DBSCAN algorithm using appropriate algorithms.

4. Explain BIRCH algorithm with example 

5. What is clustering ? Explain k-means clustering alogrithm. Suppose the data for clustering 
    { 2, 4, 10, 12, 3, 20, 11, 25 } consider k = 2, cluster the given data using above algorithm.


6. Use k-means to cluster the following data into 3 clusters.

Protin and Fat (20,9), (21,9), (15,7), (22,17), (20,8), (25,12), (26,14), (20,9), (18,9), (20,9)
