1. Define “Data mining”. Enumerate five example application that can benifit by using the Data Mining.<br>
Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The following are certain applcations of data mining.
  * Health Care<br>
  We can use data and analytics to identify best practices that improve care and reduce costs. Researchers use data mining approaches to predict the volume of patients in every category or can be used to find trends or predicting epidemics etc. Processes are developed that make sure that the patients receive appropriate care at the right place and at the right time. Data mining can also help healthcare insurers to detect fraud and abuse.
  * Market Basket Analysis<br>
  Market basket analysis is a modelling technique based upon a theory that if you buy a certain group of items you are more likely to buy another group of items. This technique may allow the retailer to understand the purchase behaviour of a buyer. This information may help the retailer to know the buyer’s needs and change the store’s layout accordingly. Using differential analysis comparison of results between different stores, between customers in different demographic groups can be done.
   * Fraud Detection<br>
  Traditional methods of fraud detection are time consuming and complex. Data mining aids in providing meaningful patterns and turning data into information. Any information that is valid and useful is knowledge. A perfect fraud detection system should protect information of all the users. A supervised method includes collection of sample records. These records are classified fraudulent or non-fraudulent. A model is built using this data and the algorithm is made to identify whether the record is fraudulent or not.
  * Customer Segmentation<br>
  Traditional market research may help us to segment customers but data mining goes in deep and increases market effectiveness. Data mining aids in aligning the customers into a distinct segment and can tailor the needs according to the customers. Market is always about retaining the customers. Data mining allows to find a segment of customers based on vulnerability and the business could offer them with special offers and enhance satisfaction.
  * Bio Informatics<br>
  Data Mining approaches seem ideally suited for Bioinformatics, since it is data-rich. Mining biological data helps to extract useful knowledge from massive datasets gathered in biology, and in other related life sciences areas such as medicine and neuroscience. Applications of data mining to bioinformatics include gene finding, protein function inference, disease diagnosis, disease prognosis, disease treatment optimization, protein and gene interaction network reconstruction, data cleansing, and protein sub-cellular location prediction.

2. Explain Data Mining as a step of KDD ( Knowledge Discovery ). Give architecture of typical Dataming System.<br>
The term Knowledge Discovery in Databases, or KDD for short, refers to the broad process of finding knowledge in data, and emphasizes the "high-level" application of particular data mining methods. It is of interest to researchers in machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, statistics, artificial intelligence, knowledge acquisition for expert systems, and data visualization.
The unifying goal of the KDD process is to extract knowledge from data in the context of large databases.
It does this by using data mining methods (algorithms) to extract (identify) what is deemed knowledge, according to the specifications of measures and thresholds, using a database along with any required preprocessing, subsampling, and transformations of that database.

The overall process of finding and interpreting patterns from data involves the repeated application of the following steps:

1. Developing an understanding of
  * the application domain
  * the relevant prior knowledge
  * the goals of the end-user
2. Creating a target data set: selecting a data set, or focusing on a subset of variables, or data samples, on which discovery is to be performed.
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  * Removal of noise or outliers.
  * Collecting necessary information to model or account for noise.
  * Strategies for handling missing data fields.
  * Accounting for time sequence information and known changes.
4. Data reduction and projection.
  * Finding useful features to represent the data depending on the goal of the task.
  * Using dimensionality reduction or transformation methods to reduce the effective number of variables under consideration or to find invariant representations for the data.
5. Choosing the data mining task.
  * Deciding whether the goal of the KDD process is classification, regression, clustering, etc.
6. Choosing the data mining algorithm(s).
  * Selecting method(s) to be used for searching for patterns in the data.
  * Deciding which models and parameters may be appropriate.
  * Matching a particular data mining method with the overall criteria of the KDD process.
7. Data mining.
  * Searching for patterns of interest in a particular representational form or a set of such representations as classification rules or trees, regression, clustering, and so forth.
8. Interpreting mined patterns.
9 .Consolidating discovered knowledge.
