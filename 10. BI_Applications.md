** Give Short Note on Data Mining for Financial Data Analysis**

Data mining can be very useful for the finance. Various bank and financial institutes usually have a big finance related data.
This data can be used in many ways. This data is always no doubts complete and reliable.

-> Dataware can be built so that multidimensional data analysis can be done along with data mining.
   Using this datawarehouse we can do following analysis.
    1. View the debt and revenue changes by month, by region, by sector, and by other factors
    2. Access statistical information such as max, min, total,average, trend, etc
   
 ->  Loan Payment Prediction/Consumer Credit Policy Decision

    2. Can decide what are the parameters which are important to accept or reject the loan.
    3. Can be used to rate the customer based on the financial speding like CIBIL score.
    4. Can calculate loan payment performance for individual.

   2. Linkage analysis
   3. Classification
   4. Clustering tools 
   5. Outlier analysis and 
   6. Sequential pattern analysis tools (find unusual access sequences )
