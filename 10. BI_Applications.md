**1. Give Short Note on Data Mining for Financial Data Analysis**

Data mining can be very useful for the finance. Various bank and financial institutes usually have a big finance related data.
This data can be used in many ways. This data is always no doubts complete and reliable.

-> Dataware can be built so that multidimensional data analysis can be done along with data mining.
   Using this datawarehouse we can do following analysis.
    1. View the debt and revenue changes by month, by region, by sector, and by other factors
    2. Access statistical information such as max, min, total,average, trend, etc
   
 ->  Loan Payment Prediction/Consumer Credit Policy Decision
    1. Banks and financial institutes can use data mining to decide whether to give lona or not 
    2. Can decide what are the parameters which are important to accept or reject the loan.
    3. Can be used to rate the customer based on the financial speding like CIBIL score.
    4. Can calculate loan payment performance for individual.
    
-> Classification and clustering of customers for targeted marketing of credit cards etc.
   1. Banks can an cluster group of customers as per spending patterns. 
   2. Banks can also group customers based on the location, or age.
   3. Clustering can be used to group into hierarchical levels.
   
-> Detection of Money Laundering and other financial crimes
  1. As we cna have an integration of from multiple Data Bases (e.g., bank transactions, federal/state crime history DBs)
     we can easily find the financial frouds, like we have one by Vijay Mallay in India. Due to PAN card links in all banks          account it becomes easy to link all account and do such analysis.
  
  Various tools from Data mining which can be used in Financial Data analysis can be as following 
   
   1. Data visualization
   2. Linkage analysis
   3. Classification
   4. Clustering tools 
   5. Outlier analysis and 
   6. Sequential pattern analysis tools (find unusual access sequences )
   
   
   

**2. How Data Mining can be used for Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
   
   -> A data warehouse stores all our transaction data,customer data, employee data, product data,marketing data, partner           data. The data can be used for data mining (knowledge creation and sharing)
   
   -> Data mining can be used to do customer/employee/partner relationship management analysis and forecasting that discovers the knowledge. 
   
   -> Data mining in Customer Relationship
   
      Customer Propensity Analysis
      Market-Basket Analysis
      Customer Segmentation Identification
      Target Marketing Analysis
      Customer Retention Analysis
      Customer Profitability Forecasting
      Dynamic Pricing
      Cross-sell and up-sell.
      
   -> Data Mining in Partner Relationship
   
      Sales/Revenue/Demand Forecasting
      Inventory Control, Monitoring and Forecasting
      Risk Analysis and Management
      Process/Quality Control and Monitoring
      Channel Analysis and Forecasting.
      
   -> Data Mining in Employee performance 
   
      Employee performance Measurement and reward program analysis.
      
   -> Data mining for maintaining customer life cycle
      
      Key stages in the customer lifecycle:
      
      • Prospects: people who are not yet customers but are in the target market
         – Responders: prospects who show an interest in a product or service
         
      • Active customers: people who are currently using the product or service
      
      • Former customers: may be “bad” customers who did not pay their bills or who incurred high costs.   
      

   -> There are two classes of knowledge discoverydrive data mining used in CRM

      Description
         • Clustering
         • Association
         • Sequential association
         
      Prediction
         • Classification
         • Regression.





**3. Design BI system for fraud detection by describing all the steps from the Data Collection to the Decision Making.**

   -> The first industries to use data analysis techniques to prevent fraud were the telephony companies, the insurance companies and the banks
   
   -> Retail industries also suffer from fraud at POS(Point of Sale). Some supermarkets have started to make use of digitized closed-circuit television (CCTV) together with POS data of most susceptible transactions to fraud.
   
   -> Internet transactions have recently raised big concerns about the froud it involves cell phones, insurance claims, tax return claims, credit card transactions etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses, but yet detecting and preventing fraud is not a simple task. 
   
   -> Fraud is an adaptive crime, so it needs special methods of intelligent data analysis to detect and prevent it. These methods exist in the areas of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), Data Mining, Machine Learning and Statistics.
   
   -> Techniques used for fraud detection fall into two primary classes: 
         1. Statistical techniques and 
         2. Artificial intelligence

Examples of Using Data Mining or Machine Learning 

1. Data preprocessing techniques for detection, validation, error correction, and filling up of missing or incorrect data.
2. Calculation of various statistical parameters such as averages, quantiles, performance metrics, probability distributions, and so on. For example, the averages may include average length of call, average number of calls per month and average delays in bill payment.
3. Models and probability distributions of various business activities either in terms of various parameters or probability distributions.
4. Computing user profiles.
5. Time-series analysis of time-dependent data.
6. Clustering and classification to find patterns and associations among groups of data.
7. Matching algorithms to detect anomalies in the behavior of transactions or users as compared to previously known models and profiles. 
8. Techniques are also needed to eliminate false alarms, estimate risks, and predict future of current transactions or users.

-> Some forensic accountants specialize in forensic analytics which is the procurement and analysis of electronic data to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud. 

-> The main steps in forensic analytics are 

(a) data collection -> (b) data preparation -> (c) data analysis, -> (d) reporting. 

-> For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's purchasing card activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use. 

-> Forensic analytics might be used to review the invoicing activity for a vendor to identify fictitious vendors, and these techniques might also be used by a franchisor to detect fraudulent or erroneous sales reports by the franchisee in a franchising environment.

-> Fraud management is a knowledge-intensive activity. 

-> The main AI techniques used for fraud management include:

   1. Data mining to classify, cluster, and segment the data and automatically find associations and rules in the data that may signify interesting patterns, including those related to fraud.
   
   2. Expert systems to encode expertise for detecting fraud in the form of rules.
   
   3. Pattern recognition to detect approximate classes, clusters, or patterns of suspicious behavior either automatically (unsupervised) or to match given inputs.
   
   4. Machine learning techniques to automatically identify characteristics of fraud.
   
   5. Neural networks that can learn suspicious patterns from samples and used later to detect them.


To detect a transcation is froud or not supervised or unsupervised methods are used, note that the output gives us only an indication of fraud likelihood.

In supervised learning, a random sub-sample of all records is taken and manually classified as either 'fraudulent' or 'non-fraudulent'.

Example : Bayesian learning neural network is implemented for credit card fraud detection, telecommunications fraud, auto claim fraud detection, and medical insurance fraud.

Unsupervised methods

Unsupervised methods don't make use of labelled records.

Example : Bolton and Hand use Peer Group Analysis and Break Point Analysis applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar.
