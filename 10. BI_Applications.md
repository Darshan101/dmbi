**1. Give Short Note on Data Mining for Financial Data Analysis**

Data mining can be very useful for the finance. Various bank and financial institutes usually have a big finance related data.
This data can be used in many ways. This data is always no doubts complete and reliable.

-> Dataware can be built so that multidimensional data analysis can be done along with data mining.
   Using this datawarehouse we can do following analysis.
    1. View the debt and revenue changes by month, by region, by sector, and by other factors
    2. Access statistical information such as max, min, total,average, trend, etc
   
 ->  Loan Payment Prediction/Consumer Credit Policy Decision
    1. Banks and financial institutes can use data mining to decide whether to give lona or not 
    2. Can decide what are the parameters which are important to accept or reject the loan.
    3. Can be used to rate the customer based on the financial speding like CIBIL score.
    4. Can calculate loan payment performance for individual.
    
-> Classification and clustering of customers for targeted marketing of credit cards etc.
   1. Banks can an cluster group of customers as per spending patterns. 
   2. Banks can also group customers based on the location, or age.
   3. Clustering can be used to group into hierarchical levels.
   
-> Detection of Money Laundering and other financial crimes
  1. As we cna have an integration of from multiple Data Bases (e.g., bank transactions, federal/state crime history DBs)
     we can easily find the financial frouds, like we have one by Vijay Mallay in India. Due to PAN card links in all banks          account it becomes easy to link all account and do such analysis.
  
  Various tools from Data mining which can be used in Financial Data analysis can be as following 
   
   1. Data visualization
   2. Linkage analysis
   3. Classification
   4. Clustering tools 
   5. Outlier analysis and 
   6. Sequential pattern analysis tools (find unusual access sequences )
   
   
   

**2. How Data Mining can be used for Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
   
   -> A data warehouse stores all our transaction data,customer data, employee data, product data,marketing data, partner           data. The data can be used for data mining (knowledge creation and sharing)
   
   -> Data mining can be used to do customer/employee/partner relationship management analysis and forecasting that discovers the knowledge. 
   
   -> Data mining in Customer Relationship
   
      Customer Propensity Analysis
      Market-Basket Analysis
      Customer Segmentation Identification
      Target Marketing Analysis
      Customer Retention Analysis
      Customer Profitability Forecasting
      Dynamic Pricing
      Cross-sell and up-sell.
      
   -> Data Mining in Partner Relationship
   
      Sales/Revenue/Demand Forecasting
      Inventory Control, Monitoring and Forecasting
      Risk Analysis and Management
      Process/Quality Control and Monitoring
      Channel Analysis and Forecasting.
      
   -> Data Mining in Employee performance 
   
      Employee performance Measurement and reward program analysis.
      
   -> Data mining for maintaining customer life cycle
      
      Key stages in the customer lifecycle:
      
      • Prospects: people who are not yet customers but are in the target market
         – Responders: prospects who show an interest in a product or service
         
      • Active customers: people who are currently using the product or service
      
      • Former customers: may be “bad” customers who did not pay their bills or who incurred high costs.   
      

   -> There are two classes of knowledge discoverydrive data mining used in CRM

      Description
         • Clustering
         • Association
         • Sequential association
         
      Prediction
         • Classification
         • Regression.
