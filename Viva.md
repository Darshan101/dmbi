What is clustering ?
Clustering analyzes data objects without consulting a known class label. The objects are clustered
or grouped based on the principle of maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass
similarity. Each cluster that is formed can be viewed as a class of objects. Clustering can also facilitate
taxonomy formation, that is, the organization of observations into a hierarchy of classes that group
similar events together.
