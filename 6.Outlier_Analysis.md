1. What is an outlier ? Describe methods that can be used for outlier analysis.
database may contain data objects that do not comply with general behaviour or model of the data, these data objects are known as outliers
Outlier Detection Methos:
1.supervised method->model data normality and abnormality,create a model for detecting outlier using training and testing dataset
2.unsupervised method->uses unclustered data objects
3.semi supervised method-> find the instances that are exceptional from other data with the use of some labeled examples.
4.proximity based->find oultiers based of distance measure
5.clustering based->data objects that reside outside the clusters 

2. What is an outlier ? What are the different types of outliers that can apper in the database ?
database may contain data objects that do not comply with general behaviour or model of the data, these data objects are known as outliers.

types of Outliers:
1.Global Outliers>data objects significantlly deviates from rest of the dataset
2.Contextual Outliers>they are conditional on the selected context
3.Collective Outliers>group of dataobjects that deviates from rest of the dataset
