1.Use Apriori algorithm to identify the frequent item-set in the following database. Then extract the strong association rules from these sets

Min Support = 30.  Min Confidence = 75 %

2. Explain Multilevel association rules with suitable example 

3. Explain sequence mining in the transactional database.

4. Consider the following transaction database.

TID	ITEMS
01,	A,B,C,D
02, 	A,B,C,D,E,G
03,	A,C,G,H,K
04,	B,C,D,E,K
05	D,E,F,H,L
06	A,B,C,D,L	
07	B,I,E,K,L
08	A,B,D,E,K
09	A,E,F,H,L
10	B,C,D,F

Apply apriory algorithm with the minimum support of 30% and minimum confidance of 70% and find all the accociation rules in the database.
