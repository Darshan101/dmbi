1.Use Apriori algorithm to identify the frequent item-set in the following database. Then extract the strong association rules from these sets

Min Support = 30.  Min Confidence = 75 %

2. Explain Multilevel association rules with suitable example 

MULTILEVEL ASSOCIATION RULES:

- Association rules generated from mining data at multiple levels of abstraction are called multiple-level or multilevel association rules.
- Multilevel association rules can be mined efficiently using concept hierarchies under a support-confidence framework.
- Rules at high concept level may add to common sense while rules at low concept level may not be useful always.

* Using uniform minimum support for all levels:
- When a uniform minimum support threshold is used, the search procedure is simplified.
- The method is also simple, in that users are required to specify only one minimum support threshold.
- The same minimum support threshold is used when mining at each level of abstraction.

For example, in Figure, a minimum support threshold of 5% is used throughout.
(e.g. for mining from “computer” down to “laptop computer”).
Both “computer” and “laptop computer” are found to be frequent, while “desktop computer” is not.

Using reduced minimum support at lower levels:

Each level of abstraction has its own minimum support threshold.
The deeper the level of abstraction, the smaller the corresponding threshold is.
For example in Figure, the minimum support thresholds for levels 1 and 2 are 5% and 3%, respectively.
In this way, “computer,” “laptop computer,” and “desktop computer” are all considered frequent.
Multilevel Association rule consists of alternate search strategies and Controlled level cross filtering:

1.Alternate Search Strategies:

Level by level independent:

Full breadth search.
No background knowledge in pruning.
Leads to examine lot of infrequent items.
Level-cross filtering by single item:

Examine nodes at level i only if node at level (i-1) is frequent.
Misses frequent items at lower level abstractions (due to reduced support).
Level-cross filtering by k-item set:
Examine k-itemsets at level i only if k-itemsets at level (i-1) is frequent.
Misses frequent k-itemsets at lower level abstractions (due to reduced support).
Controlled Level-cross filtering by single item:
A modified level-cross filtering by single item.
Sets a level passage threshold for every level.
Allows the inspection of lower abstractions even if its ancestor fails to satisfy min_sup threshold.



3. Explain sequence mining in the transactional database.

4. Consider the following transaction database.

TID	ITEMS
01,	A,B,C,D
02, 	A,B,C,D,E,G
03,	A,C,G,H,K
04,	B,C,D,E,K
05	D,E,F,H,L
06	A,B,C,D,L	
07	B,I,E,K,L
08	A,B,D,E,K
09	A,E,F,H,L
10	B,C,D,F

Apply apriory algorithm with the minimum support of 30% and minimum confidance of 70% and find all the accociation rules in the database.
